## Dev-log (issues)
- Next-Pwa dependency doenst work with NextJS 13 solution: https://github.com/shadowwalker/next-pwa/issues/424#issuecomment-1401929790
- Marker need to use ``MarkerF``components insted for React version 18
- Cant assign ref to ``MarkerF``, instead we use onLoad functinality of that component and assing it inside the function
- NextJs client side variables need ``NEXT_PUBLIC_`` prefix, required for "firebase store" to work
